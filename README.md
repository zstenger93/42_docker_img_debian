In case it asks for password, just `ctrl+c` out and let it run

# What it does
The script will setup a debian image for you which can be run afterwards with:
```
docker start debian && docker attach debian
```
It creates an alias for this called `dd` so next time all you have to do is to
`start up docker` and in the terminal just type `dd` and you are good to go

# Hot to Install

```
